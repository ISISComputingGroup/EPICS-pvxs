See where this module is forked from on github and then add an upstream

e.g. if formed from https://github.com/mdavidsaver/pvxs then

    git remote add upstream https://github.com/mdavidsaver/pvxs
    git fetch --all

now look for the release tag you need on github upstream e.g. 1.3.1

    git merge 1.3.1
    git push origin/master
